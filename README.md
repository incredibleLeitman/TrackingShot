# TrackingShot
EZG Project for FH Technikum - Master Game Engineering and Simulation

camera tracking shot to visualize Catmull-spline interpolation for camera positions
as well as SQUAD (SLERP) for rotations.
implements shadows and normal mapping for bumpmaps.

## Key Controls
### 1, 2
changes between edit mode and action mode

### +, -

allows to speed up / slow down the simulation

## Edit Mode
In this mode you can see the floating camera, represented by a pink quad.

### W, A, S, D
controls to move the camera, look around with mouse

### space
With space a new waypoint with the current position and rotation is appended to the list.

### page up, page down 

increase / decrease bumpiness factor
